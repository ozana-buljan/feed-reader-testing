# Udacity FEND- Project #5:  RSS Feed Reader Testing

Task of this project was creating unit tests for Udacity's Feed Reader app. Javascript testing framework Jasmine was used for testing. Tests are conducted to ensure that the JS code works as it's supposed to.

The app itself consists of different links about a topic. User can pick topics from the menu, by clicking on the hamburger menu icon. It takes them to a list of links related to the selected topic. Not very exciting, perhaps - but the app is only there as our playground for testing.

## Tests conducted
RSS Feeds:
*   are defined
*   have a valid URL defined
*   have valid names defined

The menu:
*   is hidden
*   toggles visibility on click on the menu icon

Initial Entries:
*   have at least one entry

New Feed Selection:
*   is different from the previous feed


## Running instructions

### Web live
Unfortunatlely, live web link is unavailable - because for some reason Github pages do not allow me to load the tests (which is the whole point of the task). Therefore,it needs to be run locally which you can achieve by downloading on cloning this repository. Instructions below.

### Run locally
*   Download the repository: click download ZIP on the right of the screen and extract the zip file to your computer or clone the repository using Git.
*   Navigate to where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
*   Open index.html in your browser.
*   At  the bottom of the screen you'll see a Jasmine section which has tests and results of tests performed ( "~ specs, ~ failures").
